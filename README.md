This is fork of 1st Quake engine, with Code::Blocks workspace and few MinGW fixes. 
Both versions (Software and OGL) should work.
Q1DEST variable could be set in project properties, so exec goes into game directory directly (so debugging in C::B could be done)

Inspired with Philip Buuck's Handmade Quake:
